The Virtual Classroom App is a web-based education platform built on Firebase that offers a secure and interactive learning experience for both teachers and students.

## Features

### Authentication

- **Teacher Authentication:** Teachers can sign up and log in using their credentials.
- **Student Authentication:** Students can sign up and log in using their credentials.
- **Security Codes:** Both teachers and students need a security code to join the app, ensuring that only authorized users from the university can access the platform.

### Classroom Creation

- **Teacher-Created Classrooms:** Teachers can create and manage classrooms, providing details such as course code, title, and a unique classroom key.
- **Secure Access:** The classroom key ensures that only the intended students can join a particular class, maintaining security and privacy.

### Classroom Sections

1. **Slides:** Teachers can upload lecture notes, PDFs, and other educational materials for students to download and read.
2. **Quizzes:** Teachers can create quizzes with multiple-choice questions, set start times, and automatically publish results.
3. **Assignments:** Teachers can assign tasks with due dates, and students can upload their assignments until the deadline.

### My Courses

- **Students' Convenience:** Once students join a class, they don't need to re-enter the key; the app saves it under "My Courses" until the teacher changes the classroom key.

### Video Conferencing and Group Chat

- **Interactive Learning:** The app offers video conferencing for live classes, ensuring real-time interaction between teachers and students.
- **Group Chat:** Students can engage in group discussions and ask questions in a dedicated chat section.

4. **Student Engagement:** Students access course materials, take quizzes, submit assignments, participate in live classes, and engage in group discussions.
